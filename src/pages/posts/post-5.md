Container queries are a new CSS feature that allows you to style elements based on the size of their container. This is a game changer for responsive design.

Here is a simple example of how to use container queries:

```css
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .container {
    background-color: red;
  }
}
```

Your welcome!
